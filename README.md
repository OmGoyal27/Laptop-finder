So you can use this project as a reference for your own project too! Just modify a couple of things and you will be good to make your own project.
This project was originally made so that I could decide which laptop will I buy for my coding tasks.


Warning: This project is not an advice for buying a laptop. You should do your own research before making any purchase. 

This project is for fun and educational purposes only.
